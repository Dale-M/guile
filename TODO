	* Update documentation to match new implementation.

	* Make an sparc port to not remove previous functionality.

	* Add two new base instructions to help dynamically typed
	languages, that use two result registers and two argument
	registers, implementing multiplication and quotient+remainder
	return from division. Alternatively, can add branch codes
	for multiplication that overflows (and reverse for no
	overflow) and division with zero remainder or non zero
	remainder.
	Suggested names for now are "qmul" and "qdiv", with "r"
	and "i" variants, and possibly unsigned version. Branches
	would use "bo" and "bx" prefix.
